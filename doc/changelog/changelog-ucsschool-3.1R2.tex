\section{General}
\begin{itemize}
\item During installation the UCS@school installer module now not only moves the domaincontroller slave object
  to the given OU but also the corresponding DHCP server object. This fixes DHCP problems if DHCP was
  installed before UCS@school got installed. This fix only affects new installations (\ucsBug{30435}).
\item The wording of "single server environment" and "multi server environment" have been unified (\ucsBug{30268}).
\end{itemize}

\section{iTALC}
\begin{itemize}
\item A bug in the iTALC libraries has been fixed which improves stability of the UMC computerroom module (\ucsBug{27534})
\item The iTALC key placed on the netlogon share respectively the sysvol share will now contain the host name
      of the domaincontroller slave in its filename to prevent naming collisions during sysvol replication. 
      For backward compatibility reasons the key file will also stored with the old filename on these shares. This
      bugfix may require the re-execution of the corresponding join script (\ucsBug{30301}).

\begin{itemize}
\item The package \ucsName{ucs-school-radius-802.1x} does not conflict with the package \ucsName{univention-kernel-image} anymore (\ucsBug{30478}).
\item After a server password change, freeradius was unable to access the LDAP directory anymore. An additional server
  password change hook now updates the LDAP credentials for freeradius automatically. If the freeradius
  process is running, it will also be restarted (\ucsBug{30783}).

\subsection{Univention Management Console modules}
\begin{itemize}
\item A new UMC module for school exams has been added along with an extension
  of the UMC \ucsName{computer room} module for exams (\ucsBug{30831},
  \ucsBug{30832}, \ucsBug{30833}, \ucsBug{30835}, \ucsBug{30834}).
\item A link to the \ucsName{UDM-users} module has been added in the \ucsName{users-wizard} (\ucsBug{30826}).
\item The smbstatus parsing patterns in \ucsName{ucs-school-lib} have been adjusted to match "ipv4:" and "ipv6:" prefixed addresses (\ucsBug{31141}).
\item The handling of special characters for the project name has been corrected in the UMC module ``Distribute materials'' (\ucsBug{31014}).
\item Fix an error which left apache in an inconsistent state when uninstalling \ucsName{ucs-school-webproxy} by removing the \ucsName{wpad-config} apache site configuration file on uninstall (\ucsBug{30928}).
\item The length of the hostname have been restricted in the \ucsName{school-wizard} (\ucsBug{30225}).
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Configuration wizard}
\begin{itemize}
\item The \ucsName{configuration wizard} shows now additional hints if \ucsName{UCS@school} is already configured (\ucsBug{30454}).
\item Some typos in the german translation of the \ucsName{schoolinstaller} module have been fixed (\ucsBug{30388}).
\item \ucsName{univention-run-join-scripts} is now executed after installing \ucsName{UCS@school} via the \ucsName{configuration wizard} (\ucsBug{30820}).
\begin{itemize}

\subsubsection{Computerroom module}
\begin{itemize}
\item A notice have been added when computers where selected to reboot, start, stop or logout (\ucsBug{30522}).
\item Possible actions for computers will now always be displayed in the \ucsName{Computer room} module \ucsBug{30513}).
\item A bug in the samba configuration created by the \ucsName{Computer room} module has been fixed. The
  misconfiguration prevented users from printing if printing has been explicitely allowed for another computer
  room (\ucsBug{30450}).
\item The \ucsName{Computer room} module has been extended with an exam mode (\ucsBug{30833}).
\item The share restriction "none" has been removed (\ucsBug{31002}).
\item A bug has been fixed which prevented that the room lock did not get released after several days (\ucsBug{30514}).
\item Actions to reboot, logoff, startup and shutdown computers have been added to the \ucsName{more}-menu (\ucsBug{30515}).
\item Fixed a bug which prevented correct displaying of \ucsName{Computer room} settings (\ucsBug{30537}).
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Helpdesk module}
\begin{itemize}
\item A missing description for the UCR variable \ucsCommand{ucsschool/helpdesk/recipient} has been added (\ucsBug{27351}).
\end{itemize}


\section{Other changes}
\begin{itemize}
\item The process handling in \ucsName{ucs-school-lib} has been improved to prevent issues with process
  signals during system calls (\ucsBug{31173}).
\end{itemize}
