\section{General}
\begin{itemize}
\item During installation the UCS@school installer module now not only moves the domaincontroller slave object
  to the given OU but also the corresponding DHCP server object. This fixes DHCP problems if DHCP was
  installed before UCS@school got installed. This fix only affects new installations (\ucsBug{30435}).
\item The wording of ,,single server environment'' and ,,multi server environment'' have been unified (\ucsBug{30268}).
\end{itemize}

\section{Import scripts}
\begin{itemize}
\item If \ucsCommand{create\_ou} is called and the given OU already exists in LDAP directory and at least one
  domaincontroller is responsible for that OU (domaincontroller is member of one of the OU's access groups:
  OU...-DC-Edukativnetz), the default domaincontroller object will not be created anymore automatically. This
  is only the case if no servername has been passed to \ucsCommand{create\_ou} (\ucsBug{21126}).
\item The script \ucsCommand{create\_ou} now configures always the domaincontroller master as file server for
      class/home shares in single server environments (\ucsBug{30285}).
\item In single server environments the import script \ucsCommand{create\_ou} now chooses automatically the
      domaincontroller master as default domaincontroller for the given OU and does not create additional
      domaincontroller objects (\ucsBug{27521}).
\end{itemize}
 
\section{iTALC}
\begin{itemize}
\item iTALC will now be shipped by UCS@school. Installation binaries for Windows (32 and 64 bit) will be
  provided by the samba share \emph{iTALC-Installation} (\ucsBug{30866}).
\item A bug in the iTALC libraries has been fixed which improves stability of the UMC computerroom module (\ucsBug{27534})
\item The iTALC key placed on the netlogon share respectively the sysvol share will now contain the host name
      of the domaincontroller slave in its filename to prevent naming collisions during sysvol replication. 
      For backward compatibility reasons the key file will also stored with the old filename on these shares. This
      bugfix may require the re-execution of the corresponding join script (\ucsBug{30301}).
\end{itemize}

\section{Domain services}

\subsection{Samba4}
\begin{itemize}
\item Periodic re-setting of the sysvol fACLs for Authenticated Users was disabled (\ucsBug{31272}).
\item The sysvol fACLs are adjusted for linux read access for the group Enterprise Domain Controllers  (\ucsBug{31438}).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{LDAP ACL changes}
\begin{itemize}
\item Teachers are now allowed to create workgroups by default (\ucsBug{30527}).
\item The LDAP ACLs have been adapted to be more restrictive (\ucsBug{31299}).

\section{RADIUS}
\begin{itemize}
\item The package \ucsName{ucs-school-radius-802.1x} does not conflict with the package \ucsName{univention-kernel-image} anymore (\ucsBug{30478}).
\item After a server password change, freeradius was unable to access the LDAP directory anymore. An additional server
  password change hook now updates the LDAP credentials for freeradius automatically. If the freeradius
  process is running, it will also be restarted (\ucsBug{30783}).

\subsection{Univention Management Console modules}
\begin{itemize}
\item A new UMC module for school exams has been added along with an extension
  of the UMC \ucsName{computer room} module for exams (\ucsBug{30831},
  \ucsBug{30832}, \ucsBug{30833}, \ucsBug{30835}, \ucsBug{30834}, \ucsBug{31156}, \ucsBug{31164}, \ucsBug{31163}, \ucsBug{31389}).
\item A link to the \ucsName{UDM-users} module has been added in the \ucsName{users-wizard} (\ucsBug{30826}).
\item The smbstatus parsing patterns in \ucsName{ucs-school-lib} have been adjusted to match ,,ipv4:'' and ,,ipv6:'' prefixed addresses (\ucsBug{31141}).
\item The handling of special characters for the project name has been corrected in the UMC module ``Distribute materials'' (\ucsBug{31014}).
\item Fixed an error which left apache in an inconsistent state when uninstalling \ucsName{ucs-school-webproxy} by removing the \ucsName{wpad-config} apache site configuration file on uninstall (\ucsBug{30928}).
\item The length of the hostname of school servers has been restricted to 13 characters in the \ucsName{school-wizard} (\ucsBug{30225}).
\item Access to the \ucsName{UMC school wizards} have been made configurable on a per wizard base (\ucsBug{30484}).
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Configuration wizard}
\begin{itemize}
\item The \ucsName{configuration wizard} shows now additional hints if \ucsName{UCS@school} is already configured (\ucsBug{30454}).
\item Some typos in the german translation of the \ucsName{schoolinstaller} module have been fixed (\ucsBug{30388}).
\item \ucsName{univention-run-join-scripts} is now executed after installing \ucsName{UCS@school} via the \ucsName{configuration wizard} (\ucsBug{30820}).

  room (\ucsBug{30450}).
\item The \ucsName{Computer room} module has been extended with an exam mode (\ucsBug{30833}).
\item The share restriction ,,none'' has been removed (\ucsBug{31002}).
\item A bug has been fixed which prevented that the room lock did not get released after several days (\ucsBug{30514}).
