 * By default, the IP address of the UCS master domain controller was assigned
   to UCC clients as time server. In numerous environments the master
   domain controller is not directly reachable by UCC clients due to firewall
   restrictions which resulted in incorrect system clocks on the UCC systems.
   With this update, the default UCR policy of each school OU is automatically
   updated and the UCR variable "ucc/timeserver" is appended. If the UCR
   variable is already configured in that UCR policy, the value is not
   changed. The UCR variable sets the local school server as time server
   for UCC systems (Bug #40705).
