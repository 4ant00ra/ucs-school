desc: |
 This update addresses the following issue(s):
 * The pcpatch user is no longer ignored by default by the S4-Connector
 * Adapted installation procedure to ou-overlapping users changes (Bug #40705)
 * In multi-school environments autosearch is now deactivated by default in
   all school related UMC modules, using a UCR policy at the LDAP-root. This
   is done only for new installations. (Bug #41300)
 * Sysvol-replication of netlogon scripts is now prevented by default on all
   UCS@school DCs. The netlogon scripts will be stored in
   /var/lib/samba/netlogon/user. This change will only activate in newly
   installed UCS@school DCs. To revert to the previous behavior unset UCRVs
   samba/share/netlogon/path and ucsschool/userlogon/netlogon/path. Further
   documentation can be found in the chapter "Netlogon-Skripte f√ºr
   Samba4-Umgebung" of the UCS@school manual. (Bug #40347).
 * The sam.ldb and secrets.ldb are not removed any longer while running
   the ucs-school-slave joinscripts.
