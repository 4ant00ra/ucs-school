fix:
desc: |
 * The pcpatch user is no longer ignored by default by the S4-Connector
   (Bug #34626).
 * Adapted installation procedure to ou-overlapping users changes (Bug #40705)
 * A hint, how to deactivate the autosearch feature of UMC modules, was
   added to the manual (Bug #41300).
 * Sysvol-replication of netlogon scripts is now prevented by default on all
   UCS@school DCs. The netlogon scripts will be stored in
   /var/lib/samba/netlogon/user. This change will only activate in newly
   installed UCS@school DCs. To revert to the previous behavior unset UCRVs
   samba/share/netlogon/path and ucsschool/userlogon/netlogon/path. Further
   documentation can be found in the chapter "Netlogon-Skripte f√ºr
   Samba4-Umgebung" of the UCS@school manual. (Bug #40347).
 * The sam.ldb and secrets.ldb are not removed any longer while running
   the ucs-school-slave joinscripts (Bug #40424).
 * A help message was added to a join script, giving instructions on how to
   rejoin a previously deleted school slave (Bug #40262).
