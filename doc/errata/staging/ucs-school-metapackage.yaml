fix: 9.0.2-7.184.201609220917
desc: |
 * By default the user "pcpatch" is no longer ignored by the Univention S4
   Connector (Bug #34626).
 * The join scripts 00ucs-school-slave-check-ou and 62-ucs-school-slave have
   been improved. This change was neccessary due to allowing ou-overlapping
   users and related changes in LDAP ACLs (Bug #40705)
 * The new default path for UCS@school NETLOGON scripts for Windows systems
   is "/var/lib/samba/netlogon/user". This change will become active on newly
   installed UCS@school systems only. The configuration of existing UCS@school
   systems is not altered. To revert to the previous behavior, unset the UCR
   variables "samba/share/netlogon/path" and
   "ucsschool/userlogon/netlogon/path". This change has introduced to prevent
   the replication of the NETLOGON scripts via the SYSVOL replication
   mechanism which caused higher load in larger environments. Further
   documentation can be found in the chapter "Netlogon-Skripte f√ºr
   Samba4-Umgebung" of the UCS@school administrator manual (Bug #40347).
 * The samba internal databases "sam.ldb" and "secrets.ldb" are not removed
   any longer while running the ucs-school-slave joinscripts (Bug #40424).
 * A help message was added to a join script, giving instructions on how to
   rejoin school slave whose LDAP object has been previously deleted
   (Bug #40262).
