fix: 9.0.2-17.193.201612091335
desc: |
 * The &ucsUAS; meta packages maintained its own values for the UCR variable <envar>connector/s4/mapping/group/ignorelist</envar>.
   These values were out of sync with the values of univention-s4-connector and have been resynced to avoid rejects (Bug #40418).
 * A (re)join is now aborted by a safety check if the version of the UCS@school app on the
   joining system is higher than the version of the app on the DC master.
   UCR variables with the prefix <envar>ucsschool/join/ignore-version-mismatch/...</envar> allow to override the
   safety check. Instruction on how to install differing app version can be found
   in the SDB article at <uri>http://sdb.univention.de/1374</uri> (Bug #41760).
