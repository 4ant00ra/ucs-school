 * Update connector/s4/mapping/group/ignorelist to avoid rejects (Bug #40418)
 * A (re)join is now aborted if the version of the UCS@school app on the
   joining system is higher that version of the app on the DC master. UCRV
   ucsschool/join/ignore-version-mismatch/.* allows to override the test.
   Instruction on how to install differing app version can be found in the
   SDB article at http://sdb.univention.de/1373 (Bug #41760).
