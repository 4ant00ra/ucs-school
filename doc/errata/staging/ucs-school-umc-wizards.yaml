 * A special UCR variable has been added that may enable the use of LDAP admin connections in the UMC user/class/computer/school wizards. This UCR variable should only be used, if familiar with the related security implications! (Bug #44642).
 * In previous versions the Users (Schools) module didn't reliable sort by class. (Bug #44663)
 * Some grids for the school administration were unsorted after loading data. (Bug #42756)
