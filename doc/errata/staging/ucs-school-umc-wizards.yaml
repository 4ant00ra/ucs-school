 * An error message was shown after removing users from a school via the &ucsUAS; user wizard. The triggering error has been fixed (Bug #44537).
 * A special UCR variable has been added that may enable the use of LDAP admin connections in the UMC user/class/computer/school wizards. This UCR variable should only be used, if familiar with the related security implications! (Bug #44642).
 * It is now possible to sort users by class in the module <guimenu>Users (Schools)</guimenu> (Bug #42756).
 * The grids for the school administration modules are now sorted by default (Bug #44663).
