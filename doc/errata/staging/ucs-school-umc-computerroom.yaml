 * The iTALC handling has been revised and improved. Several bugs have been
   fixed which makes iTALC connections more reliable. E.g. locking of screens
   and input devices is now faster and more reliable (Bug #41752).
 * It is now possible to prevent that screenshots of specific users or groups
   are shown in the UMC module. See UCR variables
   ucsschool/umc/computerroom/hide_screenshots/teachers and
   ucsschool/umc/computerroom/hide_screenshots/groups (Bug #40210).
 * Some typos in the description text of the UMC module
   "UCS@school computerroom" have been corrected (Bug #42221).
 * Adjusted internal code for API changes in iTALC 3 (Bug #38213).
