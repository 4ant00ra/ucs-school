desc: |
 * Some UCR variables have not been cleaned up after the exam mode has been finished.
   This problem has bow been fixed (Bug #44082).
 * The creation of exam users is slowed down with each additional group
   membership of the participating students. If groups are not required
   for exam users, they can now be ignored when the exam users are created.
   Via the UCR variable <envar>ucsschool/exam/group/ldap/blacklist/regex</envar> a
   regular expression may be specified. Each matching group DN is blacklisted for
   exam users. The UCR variable has to be specified on the DC master.
