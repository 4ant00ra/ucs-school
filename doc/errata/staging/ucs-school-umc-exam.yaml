fix: 6.0.7-6.117.201610061203
desc: |
 * Unnecessary initialization code has been removed. No functional change
   (Bug #41699)
 * The cleanup script "exam-and-room-cleanup" has been added, that tries to
   shut down all running exams gracefully and removes leftover users and
   files from LDAP and disk. The script can be scheduled to run during the
   night but is deactivated by default. To enable it, call "ucr set
   ucsschool/exam/cron/cleanup='30 2 * * *'" on the UCS@school master domain
   controller in single server environments or on the UCS@school slave
   domain controllers in multi server environments. In multi server
   environments also call "ucr set
   ucsschool/exam/cron/cleanup-master='30 3 * * *'" on the UCS@school
   master domain controller (Bug #40213).
 * Some typos in the description text of the UMC module "Start exam" have
   been corrected (Bug #42219).
