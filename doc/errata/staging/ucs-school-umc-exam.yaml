 * School users stored outside of any OU can now participate in
   school exams (Bug #41568).
 * Don't log an error message if the exam user is not yet replicated
   (Bug #41562).
 * Proper error messages are shown when no school exists (Bug #42399).
 * Each exam user now gets a unique home directory containing a time stamp
   and is placed (in default configuration) in /home/$OU/schueler/exam-homes/$UID.$TIMESTAMP.
   This prevents problems with orphaned home directories of previous exam runs.
   (Bug #37955).
 * If the computerroom module was already opened when starting an exam
   and the settings were changed the exam was terminated and the exam
   user accounts were not removed (Bug #40901).
 * When starting the exam mode, the user accounts of the selected groups
   are duplicated as new exam users. Mistakenly the LDAP attributes
   <property>ucsschoolRecordUID</property> and <property>ucsschoolSourceUID</property>
   have been duplicated, too, which caused error messages when using the &ucsUAS;
   import scripts <command>ucs-school-user-import</command> or
   <command>import_user</command>. Starting from this release, these two LDAP
   attributes are no longer duplicated (Bug #43045).
