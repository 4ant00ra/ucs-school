fix:
desc: |
 * The script <command>exam-and-room-cleanup</command> will now also remove computers accounts from the exam group (Bug #43978).
 * In some &ucsUAS; environments students are member of a large number of groups. By default, if these students take part of
   an exam, the exam mode copies all group memberships from the students to the corresponding exam users. For performance and
   security reasons, it's now possible to blacklist groups from being taken over to exam users by defining a regular expression
   for group DNs (UCR variable <env>ucsschool/exam/group/ldap/blacklist/regex</env>) (Bug #45473).
 * The timeout for starting new exams has been raised from 5 minutes to 30 minutes (Bug #45980).
