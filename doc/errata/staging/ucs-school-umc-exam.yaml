 This update addresses the following issue(s):
 * Remove unnecessary initialization code (Bug #41699)
 * Add cleanup script "exam-and-room-cleanup", that tries to shut down all
   running exams gracefully and removes leftover users and files from LDAP
   and disk. The script is scheduled to run at night and is deactived by
   default. To enable it, edit /etc/cron.d/ucs-school-umc-exam on the
   educational DC slaves and /etc/cron.d/ucs-school-umc-exam-master on the
   DC master (Bug #40213).
 * Some typos in the description text of the UMC module "UCS@school exam" have
   been corrected (Bug #42219).
