 This update addresses the following issue(s):
 * The default value of the UCR variable
   squid/acl/windowsupdater/allow/dstdomain-i/regex contained an error
   which, although it didn't lead to a functional problem, was corrected
   (Bug #40960).
 * A service was added to control and regulate squid3 reloads when
   triggered by UCR updates. Reload frequency is limited to once every
   15 s (Bug #41361)
bug: [40960, 41361]
