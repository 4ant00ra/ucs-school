 * The default value of the UCR variable
   "squid/acl/windowsupdater/allow/dstdomain-i/regex" has been updated.
   The old regular expression was bordered needlessly by "^" and "$"
   (Bug #40960).
 * If a new user or group import for UCS@school had been performed,
   the system load on UCS@school slaves got very high due to frequent
   reloads of the squid3 configuration. Therefore a new service was
   added to control and regulate squid3 reloads when triggered by
   UCR updates. The reload frequency is limited to once every
   15 seconds (Bug #41361).
