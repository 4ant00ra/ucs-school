 * Up to this update the UMC module "printer moderation" was unable to
   handle restricted printers that require the user to authenticate
   before printing. Print jobs redirected to those printers have simply
   never been printed. The UMC module now passes the credentials of
   the logged on UMC user to the print server. If the user password is
   not available (e.g. due to single sign on) the user is asked to
   enter its password. In case passing the print job to the print server
   fails, proper error messages are shown to the UMC user (Bug #41374).
