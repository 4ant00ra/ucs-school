 This update addresses the following issue(s):
 * A bug was fixed, that prevented staff users from being moved from one
   school to another (Bug #41609).
 * When moving a user from a school the user is put into the school
   related groups of this school (Bug #41620) (Bug #40870).
 * Users are now added to groups of all schools they belong to (Bug #41601).
 * New passwords are now guaranteed to be created from different character
   classes (Bug #40711).
 * Adapted installation procedure to ou-overlapping users changes (Bug #40705)
 * All schools are available on a DC Backup again (Bug #41747).
 * A logging function was added (Bug #41595).
 * An error has been fixed when filtering out possible schools for certain
   users (Bug #41811).
 * Temparary shutdown of the directory notifier is now handled more safely
   (Bug #41775).
 * New class / group shares are not exported to NFS anymore (Bug #38641).
 * An important bug in user handling has been fixed. If users are modified, all
   memberships of groups, that are no class groups (e.g. working groups or
   global groups), were lost during modification. This regression had been
   introduced with UCS@school 4.1R2v1 (Bug #41907).
