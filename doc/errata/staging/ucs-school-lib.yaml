 This update addresses the following issue(s):
 * A bug was fixed, that prevented staff users from being moved from one
   school to another (Bug #41609).
 * When moving a user from a school the user is put into the school
   related groups of this school (Bug #41620) (Bug #40870).
 * Users are now added to groups of all schools they belong to (Bug #41601).
 * Passwords created by the scripts activate_groupmembers and the CLI import
   scripts now contain at least one character from each character class
   (lowercase, uppercase, digits, special characters) (Bug #40711).
 * Adapted installation procedure to ou-overlapping users changes (Bug #40705)
 * All schools are available on a DC Backup again (Bug #41747).
 * A logging function was added (Bug #41595).
 * An error has been fixed when filtering out possible schools for certain
   users (Bug #41811).
 * Temparary shutdown of the directory notifier is now handled more safely
   (Bug #41775).
 * By default, new class shares or group shares are no longer exported via NFS.
   The NFS export of those shares can be reactivated manually via the UMC module
   "Shares" by activating the option "Export for NFS clients (NFSv3 and NFSv4)".
   This new default value does not affect existing shares objects (Bug #38641).
