fix: 9.0.23-5.260.201609061238
desc: |
 * A bug was fixed, that prevented staff users from being moved from one
   school to another (Bug #41609).
 * When moving a user from a school the user is put into the school
   related groups of this school (Bug #41620) (Bug #40870).
 * Users are now added to groups of all schools they belong to (Bug #41601).
 * Passwords created by the scripts activate_groupmembers and the CLI import
   scripts now contain at least one character from each character class
   (lowercase, uppercase, digits, special characters) (Bug #40711).
 * Adapted installation procedure to ou-overlapping users changes (Bug #40705)
 * All schools are available on a DC Backup again (Bug #41747).
 * A logging function was added (Bug #41595).
 * An error has been fixed when filtering out possible schools for certain
   users (Bug #41811).
 * In some situations the temporary shutdown of univention-directory-notifier
   failed with a traceback during user import. The shutdown and therefore
   also restart of univention-directory-notifier is now handled more safely
   (Bug #41775).
 * From now on UCS@school shares for working groups and classes are only
   exported via CIFS/Samba and no longer via NFS. To reenable the NFS
   export for new shares, set the UCR variable ucsschool/default/share/nfs
   to "yes". This new default value does not affect existing shares objects.
   The NFS export of shares can be (de)activated manually via the UMC module
   "Shares" by toggling the option "Export for NFS clients (NFSv3 and NFSv4)"
   (Bug #38641).
 * An inefficient LDAP search has been improved that reduces the search time
   in some UMC modules, e.g. "Passwords (students)" (Bug #42167).
 * An error has been fixed when handling users with more that one school and
   workgroups but no classes (Bug #42251).
