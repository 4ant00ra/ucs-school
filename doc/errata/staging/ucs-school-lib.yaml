 * In some cases after stopping the exam mode, shares on the school server weren't accessible anymore. This bug has been fixed (Bug #43089).
 * When creating a new school, the DHCP server objects for the administrative DC Slave are now also created or moved into the DHCP service of the school in a multiserver environment (Bug #42687).

 * An internal improvement of the &ucsUAS; library: support was added for changing the base path when searching for hooks (Bug #45024).
