 * The name of the folder link on the user's desktop can now be set via UCR:
   ucsschool/userlogon/shares_foldername defaults to "Eigene Shares". If the
   special folders "My Files" and "My Pictures" are redirected from local
   profile path to the user's network home directory, the directory names
   of those folder within user's home directory may now be specified via UCR:
   ucsschool/userlogon/myshares/name defaults to "Eigene Dateien" and
   ucsschool/userlogon/mypictures/name defaults to "Eigene Bilder"
   (Bug #37256).
 * The icons of the folders created by the netlogon script can now be set:
   ucsschool/userlogon/shares_folder_icon,
   ucsschool/userlogon/my_files_link_icon,
   ucsschool/userlogon/other_links_icon.
   The name of the "My Files" directory within the folder, created by the
   netlogon script, can now be set via the UCR variable
   ucsschool/userlogon/my_files_link_name (Bug #41375).
 * Whitespace in the list of share names in the UCR variable
   ucsschool/userlogon/commonshares is now handled more securely (Bug
   #43504).
 * Certain elements of the user netlogon script can now be disabled. See
   UCR descriptions for ucsschool/userlogon/create_myfiles_link,
   ucsschool/userlogon/create_shortcuts,
   ucsschool/userlogon/create_teacher_umc_link and
   ucsschool/userlogon/disabled_share_links/*.  It
   is now possible to configure the path in which the directory for the
   links will be created by setting the UCR variable
   ucsschool/userlogon/shares_folder_parent_path (Bug #43526).
