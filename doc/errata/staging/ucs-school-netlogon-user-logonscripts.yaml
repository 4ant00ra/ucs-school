fix: 13.0.2-3A~4.2.0.201710091738
desc: |
 * The generation of netlogon scripts for Windows users has been separated into a new daemon that
   is triggered via the Univention Directory Listener. This way, the LDAP replication should not
   be slowed down any longer by lots of LDAP changes relevant for netlogon script generation (Bug #42997).
 * The shortcuts to the users shares showed the wrong icons in Windows 10. This has been fixed (Bug #45301).
