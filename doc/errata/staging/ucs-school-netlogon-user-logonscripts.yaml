fix: 12.0.3-2.55.201608021557
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issue(s):
 * The name of the directory containing links to the users shares
   is now configurable using the UCR variable
   ucsschool/userlogon/shares_foldername. If changed, all logon scripts
   must be rewritten by running the commands:
   # invoke-rc.d univention-directory-listener restart
   # univention-directory-listener-ctrl resync ucs-school-user-logonscript
   (Bug #41173).
