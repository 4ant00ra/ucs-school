 * The names of the folder links on the users desktop can now be set via UCR:
   ucsschool/userlogon/shares_foldername defaults to "Eigene Shares",
   ucsschool/userlogon/myshares/name defaults to "Eigene Dateien" and
   ucsschool/userlogon/mypictures/name defaults to "Eigene Bilder"
   (Bug #37256).
 * The icons of the folders created by the netlogon script can now be set:
   ucsschool/userlogon/shares_folder_icon,
   ucsschool/userlogon/my_files_link_icon,
   ucsschool/userlogon/other_links_icon.
   The name of the "My Files" directory in the folders created by the
   netlogon script, can now be set with the UCR variable
   ucsschool/userlogon/my_files_link_name (Bug #41375).
 * Whitespace in the list of share names in the UCR variable
   ucsschool/userlogon/commonshares is now handled more securely (Bug
   #43504).
 * Certain elements of the user netlogon script can now be disabled. It
   is now possible to configure the path in which the directory for the
   links will be created by setting the UCR variable
   ucsschool/userlogon/shares_folder_parent_path (Bug #43526).
