fix: 
desc: |
 * The name of the directory containing links to the users shares
   is now configurable using the UCR variable
   ucsschool/userlogon/shares_foldername. If changed, all logon scripts
   must be rewritten by running the commands:
   # invoke-rc.d univention-directory-listener restart
   # univention-directory-listener-ctrl resync ucs-school-user-logonscript
   (Bug #41173).
 * The listener module for generating NETLOGON scripts for all UCS@school
   users failed with a traceback if one of the scanned group members could
   not be found in LDAP (e.g. users of another school). In this case
   incomplete logon scripts may have been generated. To recreate all NETLOGON
   scripts, please run
   "univention-directory-listener ctrl ucs-school-user-logonscript". This
   command takes quite some time and meanwhile the LDAP replication is stopped
   (Bug #42457).
