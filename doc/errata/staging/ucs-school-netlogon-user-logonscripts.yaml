 * The names of the folder links on the users desktop can now be set via UCR:
   ucsschool/userlogon/shares_foldername defaults to "Eigene Shares",
   ucsschool/userlogon/myshares/name defaults to "Eigene Dateien" and
   ucsschool/userlogon/mypictures/name defaults to "Eigene Bilder"
   (Bug #37256).
 * Whitespace in the list of share names in the UCR variable
   ucsschool/userlogon/commonshares is now handled more securely (Bug
   #43504).
