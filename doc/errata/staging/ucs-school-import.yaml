 This update addresses the following issue(s):
 * New passwords for activated group members use special characters that
   are less difficult to type (Bug #40711).
 * The script "activate_group_members" now also writes the username of each
   activated group member into the exported CSV file. Please note, that
   the order of the data fields in the resulting CSV file has changed
   (Bug #31187).
 * Python based hooks are now also run, when creating, modifying, moving or
   deleting a user outside an import job (Bug #41572).
 * During import via ucs-school-user-import, users can now be deleted if
   __action=D is explicitly set in the input data. This is performed even
   if the --no-delete option is set. --no-delete only disables the deletion
   of user objects if the action (add, modify, delete) has been determined
   automatically (Bug #41775).
 * Logging code was moved to the ucs-school-lib package. The UCRV
   ucsschool/import/debug/werror has been replaced with
   ucsschool/logging/level/import. If ucsschool/import/debug/werror was set,
   it is automatically migrated (Bug #41595).
 * A bug was fixed, that prevented staff users from being moved from one
   school to another (Bug #41609)
 * Changing user options to an invalid combination is now prevented
   (Bug #41351).
 * A bug was fixed, that didn't allow users to be created without having at
   least one school class (Bug #41847).
 * Conflicting storage of UDM attributes is now prevented (Bug #41857).
 * Program code was added to ease future development and support (Bug #41861).
 * The legacy import script now finds users in LDAP with and without the new
   SourceUID and RecordUID attributes (Bug #41862).
 * Deletion of user accounts is now done before creating new accounts or
   modifying existing ones. This remedies the problem, that new users could
   not have unique properties (like the primary email address), that
   accounts scheduled for deletion still had (Bug #41544).
 * Newly created shares are by default not exported via NFS anymore. To
   reactivate the previous bahaviour (creation of both Samba/CIFS and NFS
   shares), set UCR variable ucsschool/default/share/nfs to true. Existing
   shares are not affected by this change (Bug #38641).
