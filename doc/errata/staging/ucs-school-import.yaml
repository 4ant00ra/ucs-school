fix: 14.0.15-13.289.201607221302
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issue(s):
 * New passwords for activated group members use special characters that
   are less difficult to type (Bug #40711).
 * The activate_group_members script now also writes usernames in the
   exported CSV file (Bug #31187).
 * Python based hooks are now also run, when creating, modifying, moving or
   deleting a user outside an import job (Bug #41572).
 * Users can now be deleted even when the --no-delete option is set, if
   action=D is explicitly set in the input data (Bug #41775).
 * Logging code was moved to the ucs-school-lib package. The UCRV
   ucsschool/import/debug/werror has been replaced with
   ucsschool/logging/level/import. If ucsschool/import/debug/werror was set,
   it is automatically migrated (Bug #41595).
 * A bug was fixed, that prevented staff users from being moved from one
   school to another (Bug #41609)
 * Changing user options to an invalid combination is now prevented
   (Bug #41351).
