desc: |
 This update addresses the following issue(s):
 * A validation error was preventing the import of users with birthday data
   (Bug 41642).
 * The function to append unique, continuous numbers to usernames was
   incompatible with the "lower case" function of the username templates
   (Bug 41645).
 * A missing UDM hook prevented the creation of OU objects on DC slaves. In
   some situations, this prevented the creation of important Samba4 LDAP
   objects (Bug 41653)
 * ucs-school-user-import is now able to store user import data in extended
   attributes (Bug 41707).
