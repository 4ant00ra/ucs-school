 * An experimental RESTful API for starting import jobs can now be installed (Bug #45019 #45024).
 * The configured user role is taken into account when searching for users (Bug #45044).
 * Configuration and code for reading and writing CSV data compatible with the HTTP-API was added (Bug #45342).
 * The script <command>ucs-school-testuser-import</command> mistakenly added new students to single letter classes that were disjoint with the classes of other testusers. This problem has been fixed (Bug #45436).
 * The import scripts for creating computers, networks, printers or groups do not create schools anymore. Previously if the CSV data contained a school which did not exists a broken OU structure was created (Bug #34727).
 * Add a method in the HTTP-API which returns the permitted roles for school where a user can start an import (Bug #45717).
 * Various security concerns of the HTTP-API have been eliminated (Bug #45713).
 * The maximum length of a username for teachers and staff is now 20. Students username may not be longer than 15 characters to support the use of the exam mode and ensure a working windows login (Bug #45577).
 * The new UCR variable ucsschool/import/generate/user/attributes/no-overwrite is a whitespace separated list of LDAP attributes that the user import will not overwrite when their values are non-empty. This fixes a bug which made generated email adresses change on every import (Bug #45679).
 * Non-ASCII characters in sourceUID and recordUID are now handled correctly (Bug #45626).
