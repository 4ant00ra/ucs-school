fix: 14.0.7-1.253.201606091024
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issue(s):
 * A regression (due to Bug #40712) during evaluating boolean UCR variables has
   been fixed.
 * Added migration script ucs-school-migrate-objects-to-4.1R2 to convert user
   objects and admin group objects to LDAP structure of UCS@school 4.1 R2. By
   default, this script is automatically called by the join script
   "35ucs-school-import". The automatic execution may be disabled by setting
   the UCR variable "ucsschool/update/ldap/41R2" to the value "false" *PRIOR*
   to the update (Bug #41162, #41494).
 * The "import_user" script has been rewritten from scratch, with a focus on
   extensibility. Additionally to the existing hooks in
   /usr/share/ucs-school-import/hooks/user_* Python-based hooks can now be
   placed in /usr/share/ucs-school-import/pyhooks/user_*. Documentation on
   configuration files is available at /usr/share/doc/ucs-school-import
   (Bug #41239).
 * The object classes ucsschoolStudent, ucsschoolTeacher, ucsschoolStaff,
   ucsschoolAdministrator and the LDAP attribute uscschoolSchool have been
   added (Bug #41008).
 * The extended attributes and extended options for the UCS@school user roles
   have been added (Bug #41014).
 * The object class ucsschoolExam has been added (Bug #41123).
