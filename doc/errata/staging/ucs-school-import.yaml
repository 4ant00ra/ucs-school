 * An experimental HTTP API for starting import jobs can now be installed (<u:bug>45844</u:bug> <u:bug>45024</u:bug>).
 * The configured user role is taken into account when searching for users (<u:bug>45044</u:bug>).
 * Configuration and code for reading and writing CSV data compatible with the HTTP-API was added (<u:bug>45342</u:bug>).
 * The script <command>ucs-school-testuser-import</command> mistakenly added new students to single letter classes that were disjoint with the classes of other testusers. This problem has been fixed (<u:bug>45436</u:bug>).
 * The import scripts for creating computers, networks, printers or groups do not create schools anymore. Previously if the CSV data contained a school which did not exists a broken OU structure was created. Now, if the OU is missing, please call <command>create_ou</command> prior to <command>import_computer</command>, <command>import_networks</command>, <command>import_printer</command> or <command>import_group</command> (<u:bug>34727</u:bug>).
 * Add a method in the HTTP-API which returns the permitted roles for school where a user can start an import (<u:bug>45717</u:bug>).
 * Various security concerns of the new HTTP-API have been eliminated (<u:bug>45713</u:bug>).
 * The maximum length of a username for teachers and staff is now 20. The student's username may not be longer than 15 characters to support the use of the exam mode and ensure a working windows login (<u:bug>45577</u:bug>).
 * The new UCR variable <envar>ucsschool/import/generate/user/attributes/no-overwrite</envar> is a whitespace separated list of LDAP attributes that the user import will not overwrite when their values are non-empty. This fixes a <u:bug>which made generated email adresses change on every import (<u:bug>45679</u:bug>).
 * Non-ASCII characters in <property>sourceUID</property> and <property>recordUID</property> are now handled correctly (<u:bug>45626</u:bug>).
