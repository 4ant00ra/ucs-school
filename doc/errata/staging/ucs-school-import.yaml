desc: |
 This update addresses the following issue(s):
 * A regression (due to Bug #40712) during evaluating boolean UCR variables has
   been fixed.
 * Added migration script ucs-school-migrate-users-to-4.1R2 to convert user
   objects to LDAP structure of UCS@school 4.1 R2. By default, this script is
   automatically called by the join script 35ucs-school-import. The automatic
   execution may be disabled by setting the UCR variable
   "ucsschool/update/users/41R2" to the value "false" *PRIOR* to the update
   (Bug #41162).
