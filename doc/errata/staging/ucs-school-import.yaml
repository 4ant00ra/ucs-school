desc: |
 * The UsernameHandler.format_username() function has been improved to not
   produce illegal usernames (e.g. ending with a dot) anymore (Bug #42478).
 * Added additional log output for simpler debugging of a specific exception
   case during user import (Bug #42942).
 * The configration directive "mandatory_attributes" is now honored, when
   checking if an email address was created. It is now only an error, if
   "email" is listed in "mandatory_attributes" and no email address was
   created (Bug #42503).
