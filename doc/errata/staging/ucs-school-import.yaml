fix: 14.0.16-39.330.201612021010
desc: |
 * The UsernameHandler.format_username() function has been improved to not
   produce illegal usernames (e.g. ending with a dot) anymore (Bug #42478).
 * Added additional log output for simpler debugging of a specific exception
   case during user import (Bug #42942).
 * The configration directive "mandatory_attributes" is now honored, when
   checking if an email address was created. It is now only an error, if
   "email" is listed in "mandatory_attributes" and no email address was
   created (Bug #42503).
 * When a user should be deleted and the import is configured to instead set
   an expiration date is set, the expiration date was being reset,
   effectively pushing the expiration date forward in time. This has been
   fixed: if a user already has an expiration date set, it is not changed
   (Bug #42112).
