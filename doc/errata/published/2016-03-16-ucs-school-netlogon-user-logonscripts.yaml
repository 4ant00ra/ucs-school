desc: |
 This update addresses the following issue(s):
 * The users where the link to the school console (UMC) is shown are not
   detected by their position in the LDAP directory anymore but by an LDAP
   filter. The new UCR variable "ucsschool/userlogon/umclink/filter" defines
   this LDAP filter which by default detecs teacher and staff users. The
   old UCR variable "ucsschool/userlogon/umclink/re" is only evaluated if
   the user has no UCS@school object class (Bug #41304).
bug: [41304]
