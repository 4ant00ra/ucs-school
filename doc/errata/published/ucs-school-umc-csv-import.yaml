desc: |
 * With UCS@school 4.1R2v3 it was not possible to import users (e.g.
   teachers) without an assigned class via the UMC CSV import
   module. The error message "Der Wert darf nur Zahlen, Buchstaben
   und Punkte enthalten." was shown instead. With this update the
   faulty logic has been fixed (Bug #41987).
 * Some small internal changes were done in the UMC module to harmonize
   the UMC module with changes in the UCS@school python library
   (Bug #41282, #41609).
