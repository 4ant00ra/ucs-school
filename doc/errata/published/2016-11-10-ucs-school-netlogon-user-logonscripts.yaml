desc: |
 * The default &ucsUAS; NETLOGON script automatically creates a folder
   on each users desktop that contains links/shortcuts to all &ucsUAS;
   shares accessible by the user. In the past the folder name was
   hardcoded to <emphasis>Eigene Shares</emphasis>. The folder name
   is now configurable using the UCR variable
   <envar>ucsschool/userlogon/shares_foldername</envar>. If changed,
   all logon scripts have to be rewritten by running the following commands:
   <command>invoke-rc.d univention-directory-listener stop</command>
   <command>univention-directory-listener-ctrl resync ucs-school-user-logonscript</command>
   <command>invoke-rc.d univention-directory-listener start</command>
   (Bug #41173).
 * The listener module for generating NETLOGON scripts for all UCS@school
   users failed with a traceback if one of the scanned group members could
   not be found in LDAP (e.g. users of another school). In this case
   incomplete logon scripts may have been generated. To recreate all NETLOGON
   scripts, please run
   <command>univention-directory-listener ctrl ucs-school-user-logonscript</command>
   on all UCS@school systems. This
   command takes quite some time and meanwhile the LDAP replication is stopped
   (Bug #42457).
