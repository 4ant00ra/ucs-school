fix: 9.0.23-6.261.201609150827
desc: |
 * A bug was fixed, that prevented staff users from being moved from one
   school to another (Bug #41609).
 * When moving a user from a school A to school B, the user is now put into
   the school related groups of school B (Bug #41620, #40870).
 * Users are now added to groups of all schools they belong to (Bug #41601).
 * Passwords created by the script "activate_groupmembers" and the CLI import
   scripts now contain at least one character from each character class
   (lowercase, uppercase, digits, special characters) (Bug #40711).
 * A new shell script function has been added to detect responsible school
   servers for a specific OU (Bug #40705)
 * Due to a logic error in UCS@school library, the backup domain controller
   was not able to detect all school OU in LDAP. This error has been
   fixed (Bug #41747).
 * Internal functions for extensive logging have been improved (Bug #41595).
 * An error has been fixed when filtering out possible schools for certain
   users. This error was detected by Univention development only and could
   not be seen during production use (Bug #41811).
 * In some situations the temporary shutdown of univention-directory-notifier
   failed with a traceback during user import. The shutdown and therefore
   also the restart of univention-directory-notifier is now handled more safely
   (Bug #41775).
 * From now on UCS@school shares for working groups and classes are only
   exported via CIFS/Samba and no longer via NFS. To reenable the NFS
   export for new shares, set the UCR variable "ucsschool/default/share/nfs"
   to "yes". This new default value does not affect existing shares objects.
   The NFS export of shares can be (de)activated manually via the UMC module
   "Shares" by toggling the option "Export for NFS clients (NFSv3 and NFSv4)"
   (Bug #38641).
 * An inefficient LDAP search has been improved that vastly reduces the
   search time in some UMC modules, e.g. "Passwords (students)" (Bug #42167).
 * An error has been fixed when handling users with more that one school and
   workgroups but no classes (Bug #42251).
