desc: |
 * When run with the <option>--dry-run</option> option, the raised counter is not stored anymore in LDAP (Bug #44838).
 * A Python client library to use the experimental RESTful API was created (Bug #45022).
 * An experimental RESTful API for starting import jobs can now be installed (Bug #45019 #45024).
 * The handling of <option>scheme:email</option> options during import of user has been improved: the <literal>COUNTER</literal> variables may now be used (Bug #44993).
 * The configured user role is taken into account when searching for users (Bug #45044).
 * Configuration and code for reading and writing CSV data compatible with the HTTP-API was added (Bug #45342).
 * It is now possible to modify the attributes that are used for formatting user properties from a schema by creating hooks. An example is provided in <filename>/usr/share/doc/ucs-school-import/format_hook_example.py</filename> (Bug #42144).
 * The class generation of the test user creation script was fixed (Bug #45436).
 * When creating a school, the DHCP server objects for the administrative DC Slave are now also created or moved into the DHCP service of the school in a multiserver environment (Bug #42687).
 * The school name is now checked case sensitively before importing a user (Bug #42456).
 * The tool <command>ucs-school-join-secondary-samba4</command> checks now if the school DC has the S4 SlavePDC service set (Bug #43311).
 * By default, the DHCP-DNS policy <emphasis>dhcp-dns-$OUNAME</emphasis> now also sets the domain name (Bug #42688).
 * The deletion behavior of <command>ucs-school-user-import</command> has been improved. It is now possible to define grace periods, after which
   the users who are scheduled to delete are automatically deactivated or deleted. If the <option>user_deletion:delete</option> or
   <option>user_deletion:expiration</option> options have been used, the import configuration must be adapted, otherwise the import will
   terminate with a configuration error. The new options are <option>deletion_grace_period:deactivation</option> and
   <option>deletion_grace_period:deletion</option> (Bug #45467).
