fix: 14.0.16-41.332.201612091542
desc: |
 * The function <property>UsernameHandler.format_username()</property> has been improved to not
   produce illegal usernames anymore (e.g. ending with a dot) (Bug #42478).
 * Added additional log output for simpler debugging of a specific exception
   case during user import (Bug #42942).
 * The configration directive <property>mandatory_attributes</property> is now honored, when
   checking if an email address was created. It is now only an error, if
   <property>email</property> is listed in <property>mandatory_attributes</property> and no email address was
   created (Bug #42503).
 * The expiration date is not overriden anymore when the user object already has
   an expiration date set. This prevents that an import which marks users
   for deactivation will push the expiration date forward in time.
   (Bug #42112).
 * A regression in <command>import_networks</command> has been fixed that
   prevented the automatic assignment of DHCP policies to new IP subnets (Bug #43103).
