This small documents describes the update and the build process for iTALC.

The following steps will only work in Univention's internal development network!

Updating the iTALC code tree
============================

* change to directory ./italc.git/
* call "git fetch origin"
* call "git rebase origin" and adjust patches if necessary
* update the iTALC version in italc.git/CMakeLists.txt
  The build version should not be higher than the current public release iTALC version!
* check all changes: "git diff"
* commit all changes: "git commit -a"


Build a new iTALC version
=========================

* Install Ubuntu 12.04 (minimal) in a virtual machine
* copy script univention-cross-build-italc.sh to Ubuntu system
* update settings within univention-cross-build-italc.sh if necessary
* call univention-cross-build-italc.sh with your Univention username:
  ./univention-cross-build-italc.sh pmustermann
* get a coffee/tea and wait for build results
* copy build results from $BUILDDIR/italc.git/*.exe into this SVN directory
  (root directory of this source package!)
* add/commit the new *.exe files to SVN and rebuild this package
